# Employee-Tracker

# This application keeps track of employees, their role and deaortment, as well as their salaries.

The motivation for building this application was to streamline thr process of keeping 
track of employees, as well as the relevant information regarding that employee.

This application helps the user to solve the problem of employee organization, particularly as a company grows. 

Working on this application has taught me about SQL and the role of using the backline to create user friendly applications for the user.
